<h1>You are my sunshine</h1>
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine <br>
You make me happy when skies are gray<br>
You'll never know dear, how much I love you<br>
Please don't take my sunshine awayThe other night dear, as I lay sleepin'<br>
I dreamed, I held you by my side<br>
When I awoke dear, I was mistaken<br>
And I hung my head and I cryYou are my sunshine, my only sunshine<br>
You make me happy when skies are gray<br>
You'll never know dear, how much I love you<br>
Please don't take my sunshine away<br>
